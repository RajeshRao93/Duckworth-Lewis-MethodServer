The D/L method of resetting targets in rain-affected one-day cricket matches was trialled successfully during 1997 by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the ECB (England & Wales Cricket Board) and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU). It has already been chosen for use in 1998 by the ECB, the ZCU and New Zealand.


The method is the invention of Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis. Frank is a consultant statistician and editor of the Royal Statistical Society's monthly news magazine, RSS NEWS. Tony is a lecturer in mathematical subjects in the Faculty of Computer Studies and Mathematics at the University of the West of England, Bristol and chairman of the Western Branch of the Operational Research Society

This service helps to calculate the par score or the revised target in one day cricket matches which are rain affected.
